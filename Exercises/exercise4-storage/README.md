* Short recap: SQL vs. NoSQL
* Multi-tenancy and storage
* Different storage needs (e.g. OLTP, OLAP, archives)
* Different storage architectures (e.g. Service Fabric’s approach, dedicated storage services)
* Microsoft’s related offerings in Azure (e.g. CosmosDB, Azure SQL, OSS databases, Redis, Search)


## Material

This block contains presentations and demos/hands-on exercises. Slides about
* storage types,
* storage architectures,
* storage pricing models, and
* related Azure services (e.g. CosmosDB, Azure SQL, OSS databases, Redis, Search)
will be provided. A step-by-step description of the following demos will be created:
* Azure SQL: Sharding with Azure SQL Elastic DB Pools
* Azure SQL: Redgate DB tools in VS Enterprise
* CosmosDB: Document-oriented storage with DocumentDB API
