### Training Structure

The training is a combination of approx. 60% presentations with embedded demos and 40% hands-on time where you have your fingers on the keyboard and try what you have learned. Those who are new to the topics can follow a provided hands-on lab guide step by step. In areas you are already familiar with, you can put the guides to the side and create an individual sample with the latest tools and technologies.

Attendees should already have basic knowledge about Visual Studio, .NET and C#. Detailed knowledge about the latest versions of these tools, frameworks and languages is not required.
 
### Demos / Hands-on Labs
In all workshop blocks, it is up to the presenters to decide whether the exercises are done in the form of demos (video beamer) or as hands-on labs. The decision should be made based on the size of the audience, the available time, and the prior knowledge of the attendees.
The exercises do not form a single, continuous sample. Instead, the concepts use small, independent demos/labs. This should enable focusing on communicating the core messages instead of having to permanently talk about the overall context of a large sample. Additionally, participants have a chance to fully understand the samples instead of just looking at isolated pieces of a large, prepared codebase.

### Prerequisites

**You will need your own laptop to do the hands-on labs.** `

If the examples will be done as hands-on labs, participants have to provide the following prerequisites:
* Laptop with latest version of Windows 10
* Latest version of Visual Studio (ideally Enterprise Ed.). The following modules have to be installed:
    * Azure SDK
    * ASP.NET Web Development
* Administrative access to an Azure subscription
* Hyper-V
* Docker for Windows
* Windows Container support

If you do not have access to Visual Studio and/or a Microsoft Azure account, you can activate an Azure trial which includes 200 $ of free credit. This will enable you to run a VM with Visual Studio in it. In that case you just need internet access and a remote desktop client on your laptop. For the labs about build- and test-automation, you need your own Visual Studio Team Services subscription (free edition available).
